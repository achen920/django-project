This is a project that simulates the careers of NFL quarterbacks.

To use the Django API, use the command python3 manage.py runserver from the andys_project directory. This should prompt the base url that could be used to navigate to the specific Django API interface.

The current quarterbacks.json dataset currently only contains data for 8 quarterbacks.
